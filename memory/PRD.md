# Universal Product Search & Price Comparison Platform (PriceNexus)

## Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive web-based application that enables users to search for any product worldwide and receive intelligent price comparisons from multiple marketplaces.

- **AI Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-5.2 via Emergent LLM Key

## User Personas
1. **Consumers**: Looking for best prices across online marketplaces
2. **Businesses**: Sourcing products from global suppliers
3. **Procurement Teams**: Comparing prices across regions and vendors

## Core Requirements

- PDF export functionality
- "Search Unavailable" handling for non-existent products

- **Advanced Product Filters** (models, colors, sizes, specifications, materials)
